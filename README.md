# JAMES DE WINTON	 
- Keen coding enthuast with a keen interest in machine learning at the start of an exciting career in Development. As a creatively minded and proactive learner, I'm seeking to build something cool and be in a position where i'm continuously learning, looking to gain experience which I don't have.

## Projects
| Project | Summary | Technologies | Testing
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |  ------ |
| TweetMood (https://github.com/jamesdew12/tweet_mood)| This was my final project at Makers, I did it in a team of 4.	Developed a Twitter API in a team that would isolate the combined emotions of 100 most recent/relevant tweets related to a topic search, and eventually also deployed it to Heroku. | Python, Django, Watson (IBM) | Pytest|
|Chatbot (https://github.com/jamesdew12/chatbot)| Built a simple chatbot that runs in the command line, did this to help understand the flow of data and better my understanding on machine learning, data ingestion and segmentation.  | Python, NLTK | Nil
| Acebook (https://github.com/jamesdew12/acebook-firenze))| Built a facebook replica with the messaging functionality in a group over a week, deployed to heroku | Rails, Postgres | RSpec |
| API on Rails (https://github.com/jamesdew12/api-on-rails)| Built a simple rails API on my own so I could setup everything myself to further solidfy knowledge on areas I didn't work on in group projects, particularlly the front-end| Rails | RSpec

## Skills

#### Communication
I communicate clearly with people around me, taking on the XP values when interacting with team members and pair programmers. I love getting feedback from peers, it gives me honest and positive feedback about how I can improve. Furthermore I am confident when it comes to introducing knew ideas to a group, as well as identifying problems.

#### Competitive
Since I starting coding and getting more into it, I've become obsessed in acquiring new knowledge and gaining a better understanding of things I don't understand; since finishing makers I have done small projects in Java, Swift and React, so I can move forward as a developer, throughout Makers I've quickly learnt new concepts. 

#### Team player
I love to work with people with different skillssets because it gives a valuable opportunity to learn, as well as being empathetic to help my pair programmer or teams learning.
